I developed an android project for Roman Numeral Calculation: it can be viewed as two calculators combined together.

The first part is the calculator for Roman Numerals calculation including addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, compound interest calculation and converting to 10-digit numbers.
Before calculating Roman Numerals, we first need to validate if such Roman Numerals exist or not. This is simply 
realized by converting the Roman Numerals to numbers in base ten, the converting the number back to a new Roman Numerals,
if the new Roman Numeral equals the previous Roman Numeral, we can say this Roman Numeral is valid.
Only when the Roman Numerals for calculation (+,-,*,/) are all valid, we convert each RN to number in base ten, do 
calculation. Then convert the result back in Roman Numerals form.
The other part is for converting 10-digit numbers including integer and decimals to Roman Numerals.
